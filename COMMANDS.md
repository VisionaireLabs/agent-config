# 🧠 Visionaire Thinking Commands

Say any of these naturally in chat. No slashes needed — just use the keyword.

---

## `/trace [topic]`
**Track how an idea evolved over time.**
Walks through every mention of a topic across daily notes, knowledge graph, conversations, and decisions.

> "trace the AI upgrade project"
> "trace $VISIONAIRE token"
> "trace our X/Twitter strategy"

---

## `/connect [domain A] and [domain B]`
**Bridge two unrelated domains.**
Surfaces crossover patterns, ideas, and opportunities by searching across your knowledge graph and notes.

> "connect photography and AI agents"
> "connect Web3 and the art world"
> "connect Calibre Studio and Visionaire Labs"

---

## `/ideas [context]`
**Generate actionable ideas from your existing notes and knowledge.**
Pulls from everything I know about you, your projects, your interests, and current trends.

> "ideas for growing VisionaireAI on X"
> "ideas for a new OpenClaw skill we could build"
> "ideas for monetizing the agent config repo"

---

## `/ghost [question]`
**Answer a question the way Thor would.**
Uses everything I've learned about your preferences, style, and decision patterns to predict your take.

> "ghost — should we invest in paid X tier?"
> "ghost — what would Thor think about this partnership?"
> "ghost — how would you approach this client pitch?"

---

## `/challenge [belief or strategy]`
**Pressure-test your current approach.**
I play devil's advocate. Poke holes, find blind spots, question assumptions. No sugarcoating.

> "challenge our content strategy"
> "challenge the decision to open-source the agent config"
> "challenge my pricing for Calibre Studio"

---

## `/drift`
**Surface patterns you haven't noticed.**
I scan across your notes, conversations, and knowledge graph for recurring themes, contradictions, or emerging patterns you might be circling without realizing.

> "drift" (no args needed — I just scan and report)

---

## Tips
- You don't need to type the slash — just say "trace X" or "challenge Y" naturally
- These work best the more daily notes and knowledge graph entries exist
- The system gets smarter over time as memory compounds
- Commands can be combined: "trace our X strategy then challenge it"
